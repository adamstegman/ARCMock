# ARCMock

OCMock has an issue with weak references under ARC, probably most commonly seen
in the delegation pattern. This project includes an XCode project that can be
built and tested to demonstrate the issue.

## The Issue

Basically, given a delegate protocol and a class that uses a delegate:

    @interface SomeClass : NSObject
    @property (nonatomic, weak) id<SomeDelegateProtocol> delegate;
    @end

Assigning a mock to that delegate property will see the mock immediately
nilled, even though it's held elsewhere with a strong reference.

    - (void)testSomeMethod {
      SomeClass *object = [[SomeClass alloc] init];
      id delegate = [OCMockObject mockForProtocol:@protocol(SomeDelegateProtocol)];
      object.delegate = delegate;
      STAssertNotNil(delegate, @"should have created delegate");
      STAssertNotNil(object.delegate, @"should have assigned delegate");
    }

The first assertion is there to illustrate that the actual object is not
deallocated, just the weak reference is lost. I don't understand why the
reference is nilled, since the object is not deallocated.
